# traffic-bucharest
Using [RESCO](https://github.com/Pi-Star-Lab/RESCO) to evaluate RL agents on 3 bucharest junctions: Romana, Unirii Blvd. and Iancului-Pantelimon neighborhood.

The repo has:
- an additional agent, A2C, from PFRL
- the 3 new environments and their configs
- plot method to suit my needs
- final results from dissertation paper

### TODO:
- write wrapper scripts to only use RESCO as submodule, and have new environments be independent of it.
- update plot method to use relative folder paths
